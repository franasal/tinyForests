# Tiny Forests App

This Flutter app is developed as part of the Flutter Development module at CIMDATA Academy. The concept is inspired by the work of the NGO [Miya Tiny Forest](https://www.miya-forest.de/), an organization promoting environmental awareness and sustainable practices through the creation of urban forests using the Miyawaki method[^2^].

## Features

- Explore a grid of trees with detailed information.
- View individual tree details.
- Discover the locations of established Tiny Forests on a map.
- Learn more about the Miyawaki method.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Launch the app with `flutter run`.

## Disclaimer

This app is a prototype in development and does not represent the official views or endorsement of Miya Tiny Forest NGO. The app is intended for educational purposes only. Currently, the data shown doesn't reflect real information, but its [data models](/lib/datamodels/) are developed for this purpose.

## Future Work

Some potential future features that could enhance the app are:

- A feedback system that allows users to rate and review the Tiny Forests they visit or create, and provide suggestions for improvement or maintenance.
- A notification system that alerts users of new Tiny Forests, events, updates, or messages and air quality.
- Participate in citizen science projects by contributing data and observations on the Tiny Forests you visit or create.
- Connect with other Tiny Forest enthusiasts and share your experiences and insights.
